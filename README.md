# MY LEETCODE SOLUTIONS

Mostly solved in JavaScript, with some Ruby, C#, TypeScript, and Python sprinkled in.

[Visit my LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/HagayHaut/) for details.

Thanks to [LeetHub](https://github.com/QasimWani/LeetHub), a great tool made by [QasimWani](https://github.com/QasimWani) my solutions are automatically pushed to this repo.

**Note**: *LeetHub is awesome but it dumps all your solution folders in your top-level GitHub repo. I wrote a script to reorganize the solution folders based on problem difficulty. Pull down latest changes, run `ruby reorganize_repo.rb`, push and viola.*
